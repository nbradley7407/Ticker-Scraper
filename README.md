# coverage_scraper
Grabs the title, blurb, date, and url of a number of most recent article on given tickers from Google, then writes the data to an HTML file that auto-opens in the current browser.


# stonk_news
Same as coverage_scraper, but with more user input rather than a list built into the script.
